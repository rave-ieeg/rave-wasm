app_description: |
  <p>
    A portable RAVE 3D viewer runs entirely in your web browser with no backend 
    server. (your data will not leave your computer!)
  </p>
  <p>
    To use this module, please drag & drop the T1 MRI (nii or nii.gz) 
    or the entire FreeSurfer folder (containing mri/, surf/, ...) to the 
    loading box for rendering the subject brain. <br />
    Once the brain is loaded, you can load electrode coordinate files, 
    e.g. `electrodes.csv` generated by RAVE, or BIDS electrode coordinate
    file in scanner RAS coordinate space. <br />
    You can also render the electrodes by value.
